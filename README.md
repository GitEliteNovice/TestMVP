# TestMVP
Model View Presenter
MVP (Model View Presenter) pattern is a derivative from the well known MVC (Model View Controller), The MVP pattern allows separate the presentation layer from the logic, so that everything about how the interface works is separated from how we represent it on screen. Ideally the MVP pattern would achieve that same logic might have completely different and interchangeable views.
